Keep in mind that this will activate for everyone running the program. A solution is to make the program generate a random "ID" code when starting and showing that in the output screen.
Make sure the program checks if the effect name is new or it was deactivated previously to avoid accidental looping when forgetting to disable the effect.
Alternative: add the code to the program itself, maybe in external functions, this is be safer/more stable but perhaps less adaptable. The effect name would then be just a reference to something already in the code. This is probably easier to get right.
It would be amazing if this could be community directed: make a web page where people can select an effect (limit it to 1 effect every so often ofc). This would probably work well with the ID code which you'd have to input on the site in order to reach the "control panel". 
Make sure you as a player can set if you want it enabled or not.

Remote Control .Ini:

Remote Control Active=1
Remote Control Max Duration=[Time in ms] ; Maybe make this custom per effect, with a standard value.
Remote Control Effect=[NameHere]

Remote Control [Name Here]=[Code Here] ; Putting the code in the program itself instead of here is probably better.




A program posts an ID to the web page.
Web page create a dedicated page for that ID, with a list of items for a user to choose from.
The web page keeps a queue with all the chosen items, a user can only choose once every 10 minutes.
The program polls the queue and get an item from it (usually the first) every 30 seconds.
The web page removes the first item from the queue and shifts everything else forward (i.e. 2nd item becomes 1st etc.).

Chaos% by Lighnat0r:

Welcome to Chaos%! This mod will cause all kinds of effects to trigger while playing GTA: Vice City. As it does not change any game files, you do not have to worry about messing up the game.

Instructions:
Start the program either before or during running Vice City.
When you start the program you will be greeted by a window with several options.
The first is an input box for the seed (a number of your own choosing). The seed affects which permanent effects will be enabled and which timed effects are picked when. Entering all zeros will disable all permanent effects.
Difficulty - This changes how many permanent effects are enabled. Timed effects are as of yet NOT affected by this (will change in the future).

Below this are the advanced options, which can be shown by clicking the button. These are following options: 
Static effects enabled - Unchecking this will disable static effects.
Timed effects enabled - Unchecking this will disable timed effects.
Sånic mode enabled - Checking this will cause the timed effects to switch 10 times as fast.

After you are happy with the settings, confirm them and start playing!

Closing Chaos% will automatically restore the game to its normal state. If something doesn't, contact me so I can fix the bug. Restarting the game will always remove all traces of Chaos%, as it doesn't change the game files.
Note: Saves created while running Chaos% might retain some traces of the mod, such as changed maximum health.

List of effects:
Static:
	CrazyCones%			(Cones are bouncy)
	NoReplay%			(Replays are disabled) 

Permanent:
[4]	PackageHealth% 			(Your max health equals twice the amount of packages collected)
[4]	Vampire%			(You gain health for killing people, but lose health during daytime)
[3]	MissionSuicide% 		(Die after every mission completion)
[2]	Flintstone% 			(Force the walking in car glitch. This also changes the control scheme in a car, refer to http://imgur.com/UckV0fI)
[2]	NoDriveby% 			(Disable drive-by's)
[5]	Immersion% 			(Disable HUD and radar)
[2]	AngryDrivers% 			(All random vehicles are angry drivers and car collisions are more extreme)

When running forward, you will get the sprint animation but only move VERY slowly. Holding sprint will fold Tommy sideways i.e. you don't move at all. By tapping sprint at the right pace (figure it out) you can reach insane speeds though. Once you've reached a high speed you can stop tapping sprint and keep the speed as long as you hold any of the movement (WSAD) keys.)

How timed effects work:
Every timed effect has a difficulty and weight as shown in the list above ([Difficulty]/[Weight]). Higher difficulty tier effects have a reduced chance to activate.
For every timed effect, there's a definition when it can or cannot trigger (in which missions, not on a mission, while on foot/in a certain vehicle etc)
Categories are used to group certain effects together. One effect per category is chosen per loop, so similar effects are unlikely to follow eachother.
Effects that are chosen but then skipped for whatever reason will still count towards the loop completion.

When a new effect has to be picked, the program will calculate a (pseudo-random) number based on the seed. That number is linked to an effect. Every effect has [Weight] numbers linked to it.
Then the program checks if the category the effect belongs to has not been activated yet in the current loop and if the effect is able to activate.
Another (pseudo-random) number is calculated based on the seed is picked from the range of 1 to [Difficulty]. If that is not equal to 1 the effect is skipped.



Issues:
Might not function properly if you first run one version of Vice City while Chaos% is running, then switch to a different version without restarting Chaos% (e.g. first the retail version then the steam version).
After running the updater, the tray icon of the old version will not disappear automatically.
The game can be more unstable because of Chaos% at times. Continuously working on this.
